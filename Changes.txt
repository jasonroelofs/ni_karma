3.0 r02 added deathknights, and some german localizations.

2.0 r03 New karma.php web script to handle changes in savedvariables.

2.0 r01 Renumbered based on WoW version, updated to run with WoW 2.0.  Some minor enhancements.

0.93.1 Added data format tag to help upgrading.  Added lifetime karma, which is all points added up, but ignoring points lost from items.  More bugfixes.  Added /km create command.  Changed web scripts to read lifetime karma.

0.92.3 beta - more bugfixes

0.92.2 beta - important bugfix (open rolls were breaking db)

0.92.1 beta - Major rewrite to allow localizations.  Fixed parser functions, fixed compact routine, other stuff.  Need translations.  Probably still bugs, so save your old backup karma files... just in case :-)

0.92 beta - This has some bugfixes and a minor change where "nobonus" declarations on a class item will use up to 50 points of karma. This is because there is a minimum cost of 25 (generally), and had they used bonus with 50 points, it would cost them the same 25. This makes it a little friendlier to long-time raiders. Also added a compression function in case your website php scripts are running out of memory. Note that if you compress the file, it will NOT BE BACKWARD COMPATIBLE. You must not use a previous version on the new file (or it'll overwrite entries, although the final karma will be correct).  Still needs work on compression algorithm.

0.91.1 - updated TOC (11000)

0.91 - bugfixes to initial 0.90
